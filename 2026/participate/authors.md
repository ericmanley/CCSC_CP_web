Thank you for considering a submission to our conference. We invite paper submissions for either in-person or remote presentation at the conference. We are also accepting submissions for in-person panels, tutorials, workshops, and nifty assignments. There are also opportunities for lightning talks as well as student papers and posters.

## Submission is an Easy 3-Step Process:

1. Develop your manuscript (for papers) or abstract (for proposals for panels, tutorials, workshops, nifty assignments, and lightning talks). Papers must be 10 pages or less, and as brevity is the soul of wit, authors are strongly encouraged — for the sake of reviewers and future readers — to restrict submissions to 7 pages or less.
2. Make sure that your submission is properly formatted to CCSC’s guidelines, in length and layout. To do so, please visit this repository for sample templates and additional instructions. 
3. Submit your manuscript at our [submission portal](https://www.conftool.org/ccsc-cp/). For paper and indicate whether you will present your paper remotely or in person.

## Notes for Accepted Presenters:

1. With the manuscript submission, a [copyright release (scroll down to the Copyright Release Form section)](https://lubaochuan.github.io/ccsc-editor/authors.html) will be required. All author(s) will be needed  to fill out a release for the manuscript to be published in a CCSC publication. Once the information is filled out, please submit it in PDF form.
2. All papers must be 10 pages or less.
3. Only those works that are presented at the conference will appear in the ACM digital library.
4. For remote presentations, at least one author of each paper must register at the full in-person registration rate.

## Submission Categories
### Papers

We invite professionals to submit papers that will enhance their knowledge of academic computing topics. All topics will be considered and those papers that are accepted will be presented at the conference and published in the Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges and the ACM Digital Library. Papers (at most 10 pages, single-spaced) must be submitted on or before {{site.data.variables.main_deadline}}. Submissions must be anonymized to allow blind reviewing. Contact [{{site.data.variables.paper_contact_name}}](mailto:{{site.data.variables.paper_contact_email}}) for additional information. Authors will be notified by {{site.data.variables.main_notification}}, and final submissions must be made by {{site.data.variables.main_final_submission}}.

### Panels, Tutorials, and Workshops

We invite professionals to submit abstracts describing panels, tutorials, and workshops related to academic computing topics which they believe conference attendees will find timely. All topics will be considered; those that are accepted will be presented at the conference and their abstracts published in the conference proceedings. Abstracts must be submitted on or before {{site.data.variables.main_deadline}}. Contact [{{site.data.variables.panels_contact_name}}](mailto:{{site.data.variables.panels_contact_email}}) for additional information. Authors will be notified by {{site.data.variables.main_notification}}, and final submissions must be made by {{site.data.variables.main_final_submission}}.

### Nifty Assignments

We invite instructors to submit abstracts describing “nifty” course assignments they believe conference attendees will find useful and incorporate in their courses. All topics will be considered; those that are accepted will be presented at the conference and their abstracts published in the conference proceedings. “Nifty” course assignment abstracts must be submitted by {{site.data.variables.main_deadline}}. Contact [{{site.data.variables.nifty_contact_name}}](mailto:{{site.data.variables.nifty_contact_email}}) for additional information. Authors will be notified by {{site.data.variables.main_notification}}, and final submissions must be made by {{site.data.variables.main_final_submission}}.

In the submission for “Nifty Assignments”, please limit the initial abstract to 2 pages. Accepted submissions will be presented by the author of the assignment at the conference and final abstracts will be published on the conference website afterward.

### Lightning Talks

“Lightning Talks” are quick, 5 to 10-minute informal presentations that will be neither peer-reviewed nor published in the ACM digital library. A conference committee will accept proposals of general interest to fit the allotted time slots for the lightning talks.

Accepted notifications will indicate a time limit for each presentation. To submit, send a title and an abstract of no more than four sentences to [{{site.data.variables.lightning_contact_name}}](mailto:{{site.data.variables.lightning_contact_email}}) by {{site.data.variables.secondary_deadline}}.

### K-12 Teacher Submissions

All K-12 educators who are interested in becoming academic presenters are encouraged to submit a paper, tutorial, workshop, panel proposal, nifty assignment or lightning talk for consideration. For questions regarding K12 proposals, please contact [{{site.data.variables.k12_contact_name}}](mailto:{{site.data.variables.k12_contact_email}}). Deadline: {{site.data.variables.main_deadline}}
