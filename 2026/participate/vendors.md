If you are interested in reaching an audience of dedicated Computer Science and Information Systems faculty at universities in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas, as well as K-12 teachers from the same region â€” have we got a conference for you!

You would be welcome to attend in person, or if you prefer to set up a static display, we can accommodate.

All CCSC National Partners (platinum, gold, silver, bronze and associate) are encouraged to exhibit, at no charge; platinum and gold partners may attend for free, there is a {{site.data.variables.vendor_silver_cost}} charge for silver, bronze, and associate attendees. National Partners may make session presentations, at no charge. Please contact [{{site.data.variables.vendor_contact_name}}](mailto:{{site.data.variables.vendor_contact_email}}), if you have further questions.

Vendors who are not national partners must register, the cost is {{site.data.variables.vendor_cost}}.
