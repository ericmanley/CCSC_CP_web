Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges: Central Plains is always looking for individuals that are interested in reviewing articles for our upcoming conference. Peer-review is necessary before each article can be accepted for both the conference as well as being published in the ACM digital library.

It takes less time than you might think, can be quite rewarding, and, without you, there would be no conference!
