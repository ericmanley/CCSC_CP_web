The Central Plains region seeks to encourage student projects and research by providing a forum for them to present their work. Student papers will be accepted for presentation during the conference and will be posted on the CCSC: Central Plains web site. Student papers will not be published in the
Journal. Both undergraduate and graduate students may submit papers.

**Note:** All papers submitted should be the original work of the student. Mentoring faculty may be acknowledged in the body of the paper but should not be included in the list of authors.

## Paper Formatting Instructions

Students papers should be formatted as professional academic papers. As such, the paper must:

* Include an abstract of between 100 and 350 words that describes the work.
* Include an introduction, a body, and a conclusion/summary.
* If a research paper, discuss related work.
* Discuss methods, techniques, and results in the body. The content of the body, of course, will depend upon whether the paper addresses a development project or a research project. The body of the paper should be organized using appropriate subsections.
* Provide appropriate reference to works that are not the authorâ€™s work. The reference style may follow an accepted form or style (eg., MLA, AMA, Chicago Style, for example). You may also follow the reference style for a computing journal. When in doubt, choose the reference style of the Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges.
* Be 10 pages or shorter
