Stage 1 emphasizes data extraction, cleaning, and preliminary analysis to establish a robust foundation for predictive modeling in Stage 2. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, our objective is to support university decision-makers in making informed hiring, evaluation, and intervention decisions.

Data extraction was performed using a Python script on a Linux server, utilizing API methods to retrieve data from Evaluation Kit and Canvas, a Learning Management System (LMS). The data underwent rigorous preprocessing, including anonymization, outlier removal, handling missing values, data integration, and aggregation at the section level. Finally, we obtained a validated dataset of 3,581 records. In the dataset, the target variable is the faculty’s performance evaluation result. It is imbalanced, meaning that most of the performance is good, about 80% in the entire dataset.

From the literature, imbalanced data can lead to low machine learning classifier performance. To address this, we applied four types of SMOTE techniques—Borderline-SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-Tomek, and standard SMOTE—to various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayesian (NB), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), and Random Forest (RF) to predict adjunct faculty performance.

Traditional platforms rely on static pet profiles that fail to capture an animal’s personality, disengaging potential supporters. In response, this research project introduces a cross platform mobile application built with .NET MAUI that harnesses artificial intelligence to deliver personalized pet recommendations while seamlessly connecting users to donation and volunteer opportunities.
At the core of the solution is an AI matching engine that integrates computer vision and natural language processing. The engine analyzes pet photos to assess breed traits, temperament, and health and interprets user preferences to generate highly relevant matches. Collaborative filtering refines these recommendations over time based on user feedback, ensuring an increasingly accurate and engaging experience.
Rather than reinventing shelter management systems, this app interfaces directly with existing shelter APIs. This integration provides real time pet data alongside direct links to the donation portal and volunteer sign up. A Gemini chatbot, specifically designed to answer pet-related questions, captures user sentiment and further refines match quality, enhancing the overall user experience.

The project was conducted in a safe and controlled environment using TryHackMe, a cybersecurity training platform that provides hands-on labs for learning network security. Through this project, I gained practical experience in monitoring, logging, analyzing, and mitigating network threats using Snort’s different operational modes.

I started by using Sniffer Mode, which allowed me to capture and analyze live network traffic. This mode provided visibility into real-time packet flow, showing details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payloads. Next, I used Packet Logger Mode to store network traffic logs for offline analysis. These logs were examined using Snort and Wireshark, helping me detect suspicious patterns and anomalies in the captured data.

The most critical part of the project was working with IDS/IPS Mode. In Intrusion Detection System (IDS) mode, I configured Snort to monitor network activity and generate alerts when suspicious traffic was detected. This helped me identify potential attacks such as ICMP scanning and HTTP-based threats. I then switched to Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) mode, where Snort was configured to actively block and drop malicious packets, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating security risks in real time.

Finally, I performed PCAP File Analysis, where I examined previously captured traffic logs to investigate past attacks and understand network behavior. This forensic approach helped me see how different types of attacks leave traces in network logs, reinforcing the importance of continuous monitoring and incident response.

By completing this project in a safe and controlled environment on TryHackMe, I successfully demonstrated how network traffic analysis plays a crucial role in cybersecurity. The ability to detect, log, and prevent cyber threats using Snort provides valuable insights into network defense strategies. This research highlights the effectiveness of IDS and IPS solutions in securing networks and emphasizes the importance of traffic analysis for identifying and mitigating cyber threats before they cause harm.",,

However, the imbalance in failure data and the complexity of financial indicators make traditional predictive models less effective. To improve early detection, we explore machine learning and neural network architectures, evaluating logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and deep learning models, including LSTMs, GRUs, CNN-LSTM hybrids, and transformer-based networks. Our approach incorporates HEALTH, a continuous score representing a bank’s overall financial health, based on key indicators such as capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, and profitability. We attempt to classify when banks have failed by predicting whether HEALTH has fallen below a well-established threshold. Additionally, we use regression-based approaches to directly predict the numerical value of HEALTH, allowing for a more granular assessment of financial risk. We apply feature engineering techniques such as rescaling HEALTH to emphasize lower values, allowing models to better capture early signs of distress, and adjust model weighting to account for the rarity of bank failures. Performance analysis reveals that XGBoost consistently outperforms other models in classification tasks, achieving the highest AUC scores, while deep learning architectures with attention mechanisms show promise in capturing long-term dependencies. Hyperparameter tuning, including adjustments to model weighting strategies and learning rate optimization, further improves accuracy.

This structure often leads to issues such as data privacy breaches, content censorship, and arbitrary governance. In these systems, decisions about what content is allowed or removed are made without community input, which can result in bias, manipulation, and lack of accountability. Additionally, centralized servers are vulnerable to failures and unauthorized control, risking both the security and integrity of user-generated content.

The centralization of social media poses significant challenges in today’s digital landscape. Users increasingly demand privacy and autonomy over their personal data, as well as transparent processes for content moderation. Without decentralized control, there is a growing risk of censorship and the suppression of diverse opinions. Moreover, reliance on centralized servers not only creates single points of failure but also makes platforms susceptible to exploitation and manipulation. As digital interactions continue to grow, ensuring a secure, fair, and resilient online environment becomes crucial for protecting individual rights and promoting trust among users.

In this poster, we propose DeSocial that offers a decentralized alternative by leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized storage systems like IPFS. In DeSocial, users retain full ownership of their data, while a validator-based governance model ensures that content moderation is conducted transparently and impartially. Disputes such as copyright claims, content violations, or misinformation are resolved by randomly selected validators whose decisions are recorded on-chain, ensuring accountability and fairness. Token-based incentives keep validators engaged and motivated to maintain unbiased moderation.

These evolving threats demand adaptive, multi-perspective defense mechanisms capable of analyzing network traffic from different vantage points to ensure comprehensive and timely anomaly detection.

This poster presents the Intelligent Network Anomaly Detection System (INADS), a novel multi-layered framework that integrates machine learning models across the Global, Edge, and Device layers of the TCP/IP stack.

At the Global Layer, XGBoost identifies high-volume attacks (e.g., DDoS, DoS, brute force) with high accuracy across large-scale traffic. The Edge Layer employs LSTM networks to detect behavioral and temporal anomalies, effectively capturing patterns in flow sequences. The Device Layer combines Isolation Forest with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to address endpoint-level threats, such as stealthy infiltrations and potential zero-day attacks. A Core Fusion Layer consolidates decisions from all layers using a weighted averaging scheme to generate a final anomaly confidence score.

INADS was evaluated on the CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 dataset following extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and correlation analysis. Results show detection accuracies exceeding 96% at the Global and Edge layers, with the Device Layer demonstrating strong precision for known attacks and ongoing improvements for detecting infiltration.

INADS lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including blockchain-based logging for tamper-proof forensics, federated learning for decentralized updates, reinforcement learning for adaptive thresholds, and multi-layer encryption for enhanced data privacy.

A primary cause is the mismanagement of perishable and packaged goods, often forgotten in refrigerators or pantries past their expiration dates. To address this, we present Fresh Track, an innovative mobile application that leverages advanced machine learning to optimize food inventory management and reduce waste through intelligent expiration tracking. 

Fresh Track empowers users to seamlessly monitor their groceries via three intuitive input methods: manual entry, barcode scanning, and a custom-built machine learning model designed to detect and classify fruits, vegetables, and fresh produce through real-time camera analysis. Unlike generic image recognition tools, this proprietary computer vision model is specifically trained on diverse datasets of fresh and aging produce, enabling precise identification of items and estimation of their shelf life by analyzing visual freshness indicators (e.g., color, texture, bruising). The app’s home screen dynamically categorizes items into Expiring Soon, Expired, and Fresh, while push notifications alert users to prioritize consumption of soon-to-expire goods. 

For packaged items, barcode scanning auto-populates product details using a cloud database. The app’s machine learning framework further enhances usability: the custom produce detection model adapts to regional variations in food types and storage conditions, improving accuracy over time. By combining these features, Fresh Track not only reduces waste but also promotes sustainable consumption habits through data-driven insights, such as personalized usage trends and waste analytics. 

By combining machine learning, automation, and intuitive inventory management, Fresh Track provides a feature-rich solution to reduce food waste, optimize grocery consumption, and promote sustainable habits.

Meredith Moore",Drake University,Evaluating the Efficacy of Body Doubling for ADHD Using a Brain-Computer Interface,"Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can often have difficulties initiating, focusing on, and completing tasks. One of the methods used to address these challenges is body doubling, working in the presence of another person. Body doubling is widely believed to be beneficial within the ADHD community and aligns with the psychology theory of social facilitation, which suggests that people perform tasks better when others are present. However, despite anecdotal support, there is little empirical research on the mechanism or efficacy of body doubling. This study aims to empirically assess whether body doubling affects task performance, focus, and calm in individuals with and without ADHD.

This study employs a brain-computer interface (BCI), the Neurosity Crown, to measure the effectiveness of body doubling for individuals with ADHD. Participants from three groups—unmedicated ADHD, medicated ADHD, and neurotypical—completed an ACT Reading Comprehension exam both alone and with a body double present while wearing the BCI. The BCI recorded focus and calm levels, which were supplemented by participants' self-reported assessments of focus and calm, time to complete the test, and test performance.

Our results indicate that body doubling does not have a significant effect on performance, focus, or calm. However, our study design may not fully capture the real-world ways body doubling is used, particularly for initiating and completing tasks. We propose considerations for future studies to better reflect how body doubling is used, particularly by incorporating tasks that vary in personal interest and competency. By refining the study designs, future research can clarify when and how body doubling may be beneficial. ",,posters/poster16.jpg

Umair Mughal",Northwest Missouri State University,Comparison of Classification between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are often grouped into the same classification, and both models analyze data to make decisions. However, machine learning is just a branch of artificial intelligence that uses past information to make informed decisions. By comparing these topics, we can better understand the main goals and the similarities and differences between the two. Regarding accuracy, your model is only as effective as your feed data. The main goal of machine learning is to be as accurate as possible from our data. At the same time, artificial intelligence focuses on artificially creating intelligence to be able to think logically like a human, simulating the human mind in an attempt to solve complex problems. Humans, as does artificial intelligence, use all kinds of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) in their day-to-day lives. In contrast, machine learning only takes in structured and semi-structured data. As for timing and resources required, artificial intelligence may take longer depending on the complexity of the task at hand. It may be out of reach for a typical individual to develop their artificial intelligence model as these require lots of energy-intensive resources and may require large data centers to run, but training your machine learning model may be more manageable in terms of the resources it needs and what’s available to the average person.",,

We constructed a dataset of approximately 100 videos (50 labeled as happy, 50 as sad) based on human annotation. To analyze these videos, we extracted frames and applied Mask2Former, a high-resolution deep learning model for semantic segmentation, to identify and categorize objects within each frame. By examining the presence and distribution of objects and environmental features, we aim to uncover patterns that differentiate happy and sad videos. This study provides insight into the types of content TikTok users share when experiencing certain emotions, offering a deeper understanding of how social media serves as a platform for emotional expression.",,

Computers (GPACs) and Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) enable
continuous and molecular-scale computation. We build on our prior
work presented at CCSC 2024, where we are developing a Python-based
compiler, inspired by the work of Huang and Huls (2022), that converts
GPACs into Population Protocols (PPs). In this work, we focus on a
key early stage transformation known as Dual-Railing, which ensures
that a given GPAC system is CRN implementable. We further optimize
the current method, by applying Tarjan’s algorithm to analyze variable
dependencies. This allows for a reduction in the size of the output system,
thus improving efficiency throughout the compiler’s pipeline.

Many of these records are shared via Gmail, making it a crucial source of patient data. These audio recordings can contain valuable information and actionable insights. Current solutions primarily focus on leveraging AI for voice recognition, summarization, and interaction within a healthcare setting (Byju, 2024). However, the challenge of retrieving files from the emails remains unaddressed. To solve this problem, our research proposed an AI-powered chatbot - MedBot, integrated with Gmail which allows doctors to interact with audio medical records. Instead of manually searching through audio transcriptions, physicians can ask questions, and the system will quickly extract relevant details from past doctor-patient interactions/telephone calls. MedBot uses Vosk for accurate speech-to-text conversion and GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings to create searchable vector representations, and Gemini to process natural language queries, and provide context-aware responses. The experiment indicate MedBot can extract correct information from audio attachments sent through Gmail and generate accurate answers. This not only saves time but also ensures more accurate and efficient patient care.

sat-2c,,student-paper01,Student Paper,Ob Archibong,Lincoln University,EVA: An Experiment in Introducing AI Assistants in Linux Operating Systems,"Generative technologies are becoming more commonplace in society, and as a result, the bar of entry for interfacing with such has fallen drastically. Software applications have become more generalized and accessible, with the latest features being the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). However, desktop digital assistants in mainstream operating systems today are predominately neglected, even by their targeted audience of in-experienced users who often overlook such assistive technologies. 

This project serves as an experiment in implementing a desktop digital assistive tool for Linux, which in application highlights AI's strengths in supporting, rather than interjecting the user experience. In developing the system multiple dependent packages will be used to grant the system the desired functionality. In recent years software suites like Windows have notoriously been criticized for including assistants due to the operating systems' already simplified interfaces. In contrast, Linux, a popular open-source operating system, is often overlooked due to being less user-friendly. Implementing assistive features for command-line interfaces could serve to bridge the gap in terms of user interpretation of the Linux platform. ",Paper-ObanadabArchibong.pdf,
