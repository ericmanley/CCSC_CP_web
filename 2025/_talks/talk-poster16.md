Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can often have difficulties initiating, focusing on, and completing tasks. One of the methods used to address these challenges is body doubling, working in the presence of another person. Body doubling is widely believed to be beneficial within the ADHD community and aligns with the psychology theory of social facilitation, which suggests that people perform tasks better when others are present. However, despite anecdotal support, there is little empirical research on the mechanism or efficacy of body doubling. This study aims to empirically assess whether body doubling affects task performance, focus, and calm in individuals with and without ADHD.  This study employs a brain-computer interface (BCI), the Neurosity Crown, to measure the effectiveness of body doubling for individuals with ADHD. Participants from three groups—unmedicated ADHD, medicated ADHD, and neurotypical—completed an ACT Reading Comprehension exam both alone and with a body double present while wearing the BCI. The BCI recorded focus and calm levels, which were supplemented by participants' self-reported assessments of focus and calm, time to complete the test, and test performance.  Our results indicate that body doubling does not have a significant effect on performance, focus, or calm. However, our study design may not fully capture the real-world ways body doubling is used, particularly for initiating and completing tasks. We propose considerations for future studies to better reflect how body doubling is used, particularly by incorporating tasks that vary in personal interest and competency. By refining the study designs, future research can clarify when and how body doubling may be beneficial.
