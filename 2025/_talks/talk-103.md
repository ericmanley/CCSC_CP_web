 Project-based computer science classes are nothing new; considerable effort goes into creating relevant and realistic educational experiences for students to learn and demonstrate mastery of core learning outcomes. Finding projects that can engage and interest students while still meeting required educational outcomes can be a difficult task, but local opportunities can lead to successful student experiences. This paper details the authors' experiences in adopting an interdisciplinary approach to a project-based Internet of Things course. The intent is to expose students to other areas to drive engagement and interest while also benefitting the larger university community.
