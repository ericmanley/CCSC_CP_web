Due to the rise of the use of AI in everyday lives, we want to examine how chatbots can be used in the digital media space, specifically in the development of web pages. We will use content analysis to examine the structural elements of the generated web pages for similarities and differences. Based on a developed webpage, we will experiment with prompt engineering, testing different prompts and narrowing them down to one prompt, and analyzing and comparing how each chatbot generates the same webpage. We chose to use the payment-free versions of ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, and Meta AI. Additionally, we will evaluate accuracy, completeness, and consistency as well as analyze the code quality, checking for well-structured, valid code. We hope to find the strengths and weaknesses of these different AI chatbots when prompted to generate code as well as gauge their usability, functionality, and interpretation of the prompts.
