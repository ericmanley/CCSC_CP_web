Generative technologies are becoming more commonplace in society, and as a result, the bar of entry for interfacing with such has fallen drastically. Software applications have become more generalized and accessible, with the latest features being the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). However, desktop digital assistants in mainstream operating systems today are predominately neglected, even by their targeted audience of in-experienced users who often overlook such assistive technologies.   This project serves as an experiment in implementing a desktop digital assistive tool for Linux, which in application highlights AI's strengths in supporting, rather than interjecting the user experience. In developing the system multiple dependent packages will be used to grant the system the desired functionality. In recent years software suites like Windows have notoriously been criticized for including assistants due to the operating systems' already simplified interfaces. In contrast, Linux, a popular open-source operating system, is often overlooked due to being less user-friendly. Implementing assistive features for command-line interfaces could serve to bridge the gap in terms of user interpretation of the Linux platform.
