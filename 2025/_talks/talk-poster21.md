"Precipitation Quest" is an interactive educational game designed to enhance students' understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts, including chemical reactions, solubility, and compound formation, in both Chemistry I and Chemistry II. Developed using the Godot Engine, the game transforms complex scientific principles into an engaging and immersive learning experience. Players experiment with various chemical reactions to observe the formation of precipitates, reinforcing their understanding of solubility rules, reaction mechanisms, and the factors influencing precipitation.   A key focus of the game is the environmental issue of lead contamination in water, providing a real-world application that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving. Through interactive simulations, students explore the chemistry behind water contamination, the formation of insoluble compounds, and potential solutions for remediation. The gameâ€™s design encourages inquiry-based learning, allowing players to test hypotheses, analyze outcomes, and develop a deeper appreciation for the practical implications of chemistry in environmental and industrial contexts.   By integrating gamification into chemistry education, *Precipitation Quest* aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. The game fosters engagement, enhances conceptual retention, and provides an innovative approach to learning chemistry in an interactive and meaningful way.
