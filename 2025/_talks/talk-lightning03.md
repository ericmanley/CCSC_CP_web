The Computer Science department at the University of Missouri â€“ Kansas City has embarked on major changes in six core CS courses to integrate large learning models (LLMs) in the classroom as a part of a grant awarded by NSF. The UMKC CS department is analyzing how to better utilize LLMs as learning tools to enhance problem-solving and programming skills while ensuring these tools are used responsibly. Professors Hare and Gladbach will discuss the modifications being implemented within their department, highlighting the specific changes they have made in their own classes to adapt to the evolving educational landscape shaped by the accessibility and impact of AI models in the classroom. (Note: this presentation will take two lightning talk slots for a total of 15 minutes)
