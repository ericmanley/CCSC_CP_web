 Generative AI is a transformative technology that impacts various fields, including software development, data analytics, and cybersecurity. To address this, we have designed and developed a Generative AI course for technologists, integrating foundational knowledge of various Gen AI architecture models with hands-on practical experience using Python libraries, including HuggingFace. This paper discusses the detailed course structure and assessments. A pedagogical evaluation approach is followed to identify the challenges encountered in the course and how to overcome them. The results demonstrate that the Generative AI Course for Technologists effectively equips students with technical expertise and critical thinking skills through a balanced combination of theoretical concepts and practical exercises, such as chatbot development and prompt engineering. The course addresses challenges like hardware limitations and API integration by proposing future improvements, including a dedicated Python module and access to cloud-based GPU tools, ensuring learners are well-prepared to navigate and ethically apply Generative AI in real-world contexts."
