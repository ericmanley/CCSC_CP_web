 We report on our experience implementing a parachute program that identifies struggling students in a Computer Science I course and invites them to "parachute" out and start over mid-semester in a lower-level computing course that still confers credit toward their degree program. This program gives students a second chance at success, aims to improve student outcomes in early computing curricula, and to improve retention overall in computing majors.
