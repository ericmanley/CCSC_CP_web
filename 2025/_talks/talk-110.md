 The COVID pandemic has significantly influenced educational methodologies, leading to a shift towards more interactive and technology-integrated teaching approaches. Live-coding, which involves real-time coding demonstrations, has gained recognition as a valuable tool in computer science education. This study investigates the impact of the pandemic on the popularity and application of live-coding. By conducting a comprehensive literature review of 22 research papers, this study categorizes the papers based on their publication date relative to the pandemic: pre-COVID (2017 to 2019), during COVID (2020 to 2022), and post-COVID (2023 to 2024). The papers were selected using a specific search query for live-coding in introductory computer science education on Google Scholar. A systematic literature review was performed to determine their sentiment towards live-coding, categorizing the sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. The sentiment data were then statistically analyzed using Fisher's Exact Test to assess significant differences across the three periods. Results from this manuscript indicate shifts in positive sentiment towards live-coding during and after the pandemic.
