Computer science education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of technology, yet accessibility and inclusion are often overlooked in curricula. This keynote will provide a practical guide to accessible computing, equipping attendees with strategies to create more inclusive learning environments. We’ll explore why accessibility matters—ethically, legally, and pedagogically—and how it benefits all students, not just those with disabilities. Key topics include the difference between teaching accessibility as a subject and teaching accessibly as an educator, the fundamentals of disability language, and the distinction between assistive and accessible technology. Attendees will also gain insight into accommodations, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and effective ways to support neurodivergent students in CS classrooms. The session will wrap up with simple, actionable steps that educators can implement immediately, along with a curated list of resources for those who want to explore accessibility in more depth. Whether you're new to accessibility or looking to refine your approach, this talk will provide the knowledge and tools to make computing education more accessible.
