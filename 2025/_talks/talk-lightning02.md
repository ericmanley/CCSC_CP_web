This proposed research project applies the model-based design (MBD) methodology and its important associate verification technique called model-based testing to efficiently construct and analyze dependable edge node devices for the Internet of Things (IoT). MATLAB presented their solutions of supporting IoT Systems by helping develop and test edge node devices, access and aggregate data, and analyze IoT sensor data.  To be specific, Simulink supports developing algorithms as the dataflow diagrams on the low-cost edge node hardware platforms for prototyping IoT systems. We defined new modeling blocks in the Matlab/Simulink package for developing end node devices on ARM Cortex STM32 L4 microcontrollers.
