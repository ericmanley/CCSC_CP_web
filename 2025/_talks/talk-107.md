 Most computing departments offer one or two undergraduate programs, but the CSIT Department at a mid-south state university offers three, all three accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET): Computer Information Systems, Computer Information Technology, and Computer Science. In 2018, an integrated 3-in-1 B.S. program structure was adopted, which earned ABET accreditation in 2021-2022. With about 650 majors and 100-150 graduates annually, the streamlined curriculum has optimized resources and contributed to the department's success.
