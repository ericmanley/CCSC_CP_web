This study, “Semantic Analysis of AI’s Societal Impact,” examines the discourse surrounding AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT, by analyzing keyword frequencies and thematic patterns. The research involves data extraction from various discussions, followed by a structured data-cleaning pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Regular Expressions (re) to ensure the removal of irrelevant symbols and noise while preserving textual integrity.  To extract meaningful insights, we employ YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) for automatic keyword identification, highlighting the most relevant words and phrases. Additionally, word cloud visualizations are generated to offer an intuitive representation of dominant discussion topics.  The top five key impact areas are extracted from the topic extraction results:  1. Children and Family Impact – AI's growing influence on children's education, family interactions, and concerns regarding exposure to inappropriate content.  2. Media and Entertainment Influence – AI’s role in content creation, movie narratives, and algorithm-driven engagement, reshaping the entertainment landscape.  3. Corporate and Military Concerns – Ethical dilemmas in automation, AI-driven business decision-making, and the implications of AI in military applications.  4. Health and Misinformation – AI’s influence on healthcare advancements, research, and its potential to spread or counteract misinformation.  5. Freedom and Societal Fears – Public concerns surrounding AI's impact on privacy, democracy, and existential risks to human control.  Through topic extraction and keyword analysis, this research provides valuable insights into public discourse on AI, uncovering critical themes that shape perceptions and concerns. By leveraging semantic analysis techniques, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of AI's evolving role, enabling informed decision-making, trend analysis, and responsible AI governance.
