 This study explores the impact of class size and course modality on student learning outcomes, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to design Information Systems and Cybersecurity graduate courses. To address challenges like larger class sizes, diverse formats, and AI reliance, IaC principles such as scalability, modularity, and repeatability were applied to course design. Tools like LMS blueprints and modular templates ensured consistency across online and in-person formats. Analysis of student feedback and grades showed that smaller classes and individual assignments improved outcomes, while group work fostered collaboration. The findings suggest that IaC-inspired strategies can improve scalability and quality in graduate education.
