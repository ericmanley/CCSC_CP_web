 Significant growth in Computer and Mathematical Occupations can be seen in the coming decade while outpacing other fields with a double margin of median pay and a high demand for specialized skills driven by technological advancements. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), between 2023-2033, the United States is projected to see a 11% and 7% growth in the Computer and Mathematical Occupations sector with more than 393,000 jobs annually [5] [6] [3]. This paper examines national trends in Computer and Mathematical Occupations, including wages, growth, and a particular focus on the Central Plains region (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska). The median national annual salary for these roles varies from $101,000 - $104,000, while their regional pay might vary based on geographical development [5] [3]. Among the compared states, Missouri has the highest growth rate in the region, with roles like Data Scientists and Software Developers leading the chart. While Nebraska and Iowa have a moderate growth rate for roles like Data Scientists and Information Security Analysts roles, Kansas is projected to see a high growth rate in Actuaries. In addition, this study underscores the variations in employment per 1000 jobs and growth rates, stressing the need for targeted skill development to increase opportunities in this evolving and technology-influenced field. Descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to explore regional competitiveness and distributions by providing information to educators, students, and policy makers.
