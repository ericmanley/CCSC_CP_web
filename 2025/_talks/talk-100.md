 This paper explores the design of a DevOps-based information systems (IS) capstone course in a Master of Science in Information Systems program. The researchers aim to investigate this teaching case to gather direct student feedback and provide insights for instructors to adapt the DevOps method in IS capstone projects. The study addresses the research questions and identifies key findings through inductive content analysis of 32 student feedback responses from two consecutive semesters. The preliminary results contribute to the field of information systems education and encourage more instructors to engage with DevOps-based IS capstone projects.
