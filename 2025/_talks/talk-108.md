 Nowadays, with the development of cloud computing, various lab environments have emerged, which, however, have seldom been compared with each other. In this paper, we have conducted a survey on different lab environments for Digital Forensics course, i.e. NDG (Network Development Group), Cengage MindTap, and running labs on personal computers. In the survey, students have expressed their preferences and evaluated each lab environment. We believe this study can help instructors select the right lab environment for Digital Forensics course or similar courses.
