<br/><br/>Olin Hall is the building just north of Collier-Scripps (where you should check-in). Enter through the doors on the southwest corner of the building and head down the main stairs. You'll find Room 101 on your left as you descend.<br/><br/>![room image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Olin.jpg){: style="max-height:400px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }
